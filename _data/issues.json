When we did that we gained was some freedom and the ability to have our content editable on GitHub. We\u2019ve received quite a few pull requests from our readers to fix our typos and optimize our images. As our blog got more complicated, we started making mistakes that were hard to catch before publishing. As of today, we\u2019ve found a way to catch many (maybe all) of those errors, before they end up in your browser.\r\n\r\n## Who needs to clear\r\n- [ ] @NoahKunin \r\n- [ ] @OriHoffer \r\n- [ ] OCIA/Gia\r\n\r\nWe should also wait until we're actually _doing_ this testing on 18f.gsa.gov before bragging about doing it. Making that happen is as easy as merging 18f/18f.gsa.gov#1059 and 18f/18f.gsa.gov#927. Also, I should write some unit tests for the gem.\r\n\r\nDraft: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1euA2ovWytWd0zcwy6cmTB2ebEeca5p6Z13mbo7FtR5A/edit", "labels": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/18F/blog-drafts/labels/culture", "color": "bfd4f2", "name": "culture"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/18F/blog-drafts/labels/how%20we%20work", "color": "bfe5bf", "name": "how we work"}], "locked": false, "title": "How we test 18f.gsa.gov", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/18F/blog-drafts/issues/271", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/18F/blog-drafts/issues/271/labels{/name}", "created_at": "2015-08-04T19:15:36Z", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/18F/blog-drafts/issues/271/events", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/18F/blog-drafts/issues/271/comments", "html_url": "https://github.com/18F/blog-drafts/issues/271", "comments": 0, "number": 271, "updated_at": "2015-08-04T19:18:36Z", "assignee": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/gboone", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312468?v=3", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/received_events", "gravatar_id": "", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "site_admin": false, "login": "gboone", "type": "User", "id": 312468, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/followers"}, "state": "open", "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/gboone", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312468?v=3", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/received_events", "gravatar_id": "", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "site_admin": false, "login": "gboone", "type": "User", "id": 312468, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gboone/followers"}, "milestone": {"description": "move an issue to the \"draft\" milestone once you've \"picked up\" the issue and started writing", "title": "draft", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/18F/blog-drafts/milestones/4", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/18F/blog-drafts/milestones/4/labels", "created_at": "2014-03-25T07:10:36Z", "creator": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/quepol", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1841120?v=3", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/received_events", "gravatar_id": "", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "site_admin": false, "login": "quepol", "type": "User", "id": 1841120, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/quepol/followers"}, "number": 4, "html_url": "https://github.com/18F/blog-drafts/milestones/draft", "updated_at": "2015-08-19T15:36:16Z", "due_on": null, "state": "open", "closed_issues": 6, "open_issues": 20, "closed_at": null, "id": 608950}, "closed_at": null, "id": 99041274}, {"body": "## Audience:\r\n\r\nAnyone who cares about open source, people curious about how to adapt our projects.\r\n## Goal of blog post:\r\n\r\nAsk people from Boston how they found out about CALC, what they're using it for, and what advice they would give to other cities.\r\n##Imagery ideas:\r\n\r\nBoston skyline.\r\n## Description:\r\n[Boston is using CALC!](https://twitter.com/jfh/status/628590338538647552) Yay!

Single page sites are definitely in vogue right now, and an emerging hypothesis is that the design works for certain types of content.

Though 18F has played a pivotal role in this pilot, it's important to lift up the work of others, de-emphasizing 18F, if we're to change culture. And the DATA Act culture is tricky--it's an unfunded piece of work that Congress has demanded of agencies.

ideas for a post we could write about the way we use Slack, both as an organization and as individuals:\r\n\r\n*Organization*\r\n- Using custom bots to build culture\r\n- The new `#news` vs
