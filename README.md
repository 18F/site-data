The 18F Site Manager is a resource the 18F Outreach team uses to manage different aspects of the 18F website and blog. It was originally created to help track the growth in authorship from month to month but has recently grown to include a status report of sorts on blog posts as they move through the approval process.

The project is currently hosted at https://blogalytics.18f.gov and is  password protected. Ask someone on the outreach team for the user name and password if you'd like access.

This is very much a work in progress. Ideally the near term future of this project will give the team insight into how long it takes each post to go through the publishing process from idea to published. The longer term would also allow us to visualize the posts that are in each stage and interface with the GitHub API to move posts from one phase to the next as they are ready.
